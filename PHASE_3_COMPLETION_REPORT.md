## Firestore Rules Updates

### New Rules Added
```javascript
// Admin function
function isAdmin() { return isSignedIn() && request.auth.token.admin == true; }

// Products catalog (read by authenticated, write by admin)
match /products/{productId} {
  allow read: if isSignedIn();
  allow write: if isAdmin();
}

// Promotions (read by authenticated, write by admin)
match /promotions/{promotionId} {
  allow read: if isSignedIn();
  allow write: if isAdmin();
}

// Wallet ledger (read by owner, server-only writes)
match /users/{uid}/wallet/ledger/{ledgerId} {
  allow read: if isSelf(uid);
  allow write: if false; // server-only
}
```

PRODUCT_SOT=gsm

# Disable negative balances
ALLOW_NEGATIVE_BALANCE=0
```

### Data Rollback
- **Products**: Delete from Firestore, revert to GSM
- **Ledger**: Immutable - no rollback needed
- **Wallet**: Use admin panel to adjust balances

### Deployment Rollback
- **Code**: Revert to previous deployment
- **Indexes**: Firestore indexes can be deleted if needed
- **Rules**: Revert to previous security rules

2. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure alerts and dashboards
3. **Admin Training**: Train operators on admin panel usage
4. **Documentation**: Update runbooks and procedures

### Short Term (Month 1)
1. **Performance Monitoring**: Track webhook response times
2. **Usage Analysis**: Monitor admin panel usage patterns
3. **Feature Optimization**: Tune based on real-world usage
4. **Promotion System**: Implement promotion redemption

### Long Term (Quarter 1)
1. **Phase 4 Planning**: Begin next phase requirements
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Enhanced reporting and insights
3. **API Expansion**: Additional admin endpoints
4. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end testing with PayNow
