## Success Metrics

You'll know Phase 1 is complete when:

1. **Dashboard populated** with real data
2. **Alerts created** and at least one fired
3. **Tests passed** with expected behaviors:
   - Happy path credits points
   - Duplicate is idempotent
   - Bad requests rejected
4. **Performance verified** at p95 < 250ms
5. **Zero client writes** confirmed

## Time Estimate

Total time: **35-45 minutes**
- Setup: 15-20 min
- Testing: 15 min
- Documentation: 5-10 min

## Common Issues & Solutions

**"No data" on dashboard?**
â†’ Run test scenarios first, wait 2-3 minutes

**Alerts not in list?**
â†’ Did you click "CREATE POLICY" for each one?

**Test script fails?**
â†’ Check environment variables are set correctly

**High latency?**
â†’ First request is often slow (cold start), check subsequent requests

## Next Steps

Once Phase 1 is complete:

1. **Celebrate!** ðŸŽ‰ You have full observability
2. **Monitor for 24h** to see real patterns
3. **Ready for Phase 2** - Queue/Worker split

## Quick Win

Start with the happy path test - if that works and you see:
- Logs appearing
- Metrics incrementing  
- Dashboard updating
- Wallet balance increased

Then you know the core system is working and can proceed with confidence through the remaining tests.
