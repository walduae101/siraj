# 🚀 Phase 1 - Simplified Activation Approach

## Current Status
- ✅ Metrics created (all 4)
- ✅ Dashboard available
- ✅ Notification channel created
- ❌ Alerts not created (manual UI issues)

## 💡 Simplified Plan

### Option A: Proceed Without Alerts (For Now)
We can:
1. Run the test scenarios
2. Verify webhook functionality works
3. Check metrics are collecting data
4. Come back to alerts later

### Option B: Use Existing Test Script
We have a ready-to-use test script at `scripts/test-webhook-scenarios.ts`

---

## 🎯 Let's Test Now!

### Quick Test Execution:

```powershell
# 1. Check if webhook secret is configured
$env:PAYNOW_WEBHOOK_SECRET = gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret="paynow-webhook-secret" 2>$null

if (-not $env:PAYNOW_WEBHOOK_SECRET) {
    Write-Host "Setting TEST webhook secret..."
    $env:PAYNOW_WEBHOOK_SECRET = "test-webhook-secret-123"
}

# 2. Run the test scenarios
npm install --no-save tsx dotenv
npx tsx scripts/test-webhook-scenarios.ts
```

### Manual Alternative:
```powershell
# Quick health check
curl https://siraj.life/api/paynow/webhook
# Expected: 405 Method Not Allowed (good!)
```

## 📊 What to Monitor During Tests

### 1. Logs Explorer
```
jsonPayload.component="paynow_webhook"
timestamp >= "2025-01-10T00:00:00Z"
```

### 2. Metrics Dashboard
- Should see request counts increase
- Should see points credited (if using valid products)
- Should see latency measurements

### 3. Firestore
- Check `webhookEvents` collection for new entries
- Check test user's wallet/ledger for credits

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Let's proceed with Option B** - Run tests using the existing script. This will:
1. Prove the webhook works
2. Generate metric data
3. Give us real logs to verify
4. Make alert creation easier later (with actual data)

Alerts can be added anytime - they're not blocking for functionality verification.

## Ready to Execute?

Type **"run tests"** and I'll execute the test scenarios immediately.
