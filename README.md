## Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- pnpm

## Setup
This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Environment
Create your .env file with the following command

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then make sure to fill in your environment variables.

### Running the Development Server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

## Theming
The website's color scheme is fully configurable by editing the CSS file located at `/src/styles/globals.css`

## CDN & Security

Siraj is deployed with enterprise-grade CDN and security headers for optimal performance and protection.

### Quick Verification Commands

**HTML (expect no-store + security headers):**
```bash
curl -sSI https://siraj.life | egrep -i '^(HTTP|cache-control|content-type|vary|strict-transport|x-content-type-options|x-frame-options|referrer-policy|permissions-policy|content-security-policy)'
```

**API (expect JSON + no-store):**
```bash
curl -sSI https://siraj.life/api/health | egrep -i '^(HTTP|cache-control|content-type)'
```

**Real chunk (expect immutable, no security headers):**
```bash
ASSET=$(curl -s https://siraj.life | grep -oE '/_next/static/(chunks|app)/[^"]+\.js' | head -1)
curl -sSI "https://siraj.life$ASSET" | egrep -i '^(HTTP|cache-control|content-type|age|etag)'
```

### Security Features
- **Immutable static assets** with optimal caching
- **HTML/API security headers** through CDN
- **Multi-region parity** with automated enforcement
- **CSP Report-Only** monitoring (enforcement planned for Sep 6, 2025)

## Branching Policy

This repository follows a strict branching policy to maintain code quality and streamline development:

### Branch Structure
- **`main`** - The only long-lived branch, contains production-ready code
- **Feature branches** - Short-lived branches for development work (e.g., `sprint1/feature-name`, `hotfix/critical-fix`)

### Development Workflow
1. **Create feature branch** from `main`: `git checkout -b sprint1/feature-name`
2. **Develop and test** your changes locally
3. **Push branch** and create a pull request
4. **Code review** - At least one approval required
5. **Merge via squash** - Maintains linear history
6. **Auto-deletion** - Feature branches are automatically deleted after merge

### Branch Protection Rules
- âœ… Require pull request reviews (minimum 1 approval)
- âœ… Require status checks to pass before merging
- âœ… Require branches to be up to date before merging
- âœ… Require conversation resolution before merging
- âœ… Require linear history (enforces squash merges)
- âœ… Restrict direct pushes to `main`
- âœ… Block force pushes and deletions
- âœ… Auto-delete head branches after merge

### Naming Conventions
- `sprint*/` - Sprint-related features
- `hotfix/` - Critical production fixes
- `feature/` - General features
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
