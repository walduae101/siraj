# Known False Positive CVEs

**Updated on: 2025-01-10**

This document tracks CVEs that are reported by security scanners but are actually false positives or have negligible impact in our deployment context.

## CVE-2023-45853 - MiniZip Integer Overflow

**Severity**: Critical (CVSS 9.8)  
**Component**: zlib 1.2.13.dfsg-1 (Debian 12)  
**Scanner**: Google Cloud Security Insights  
**Status**: **FALSE POSITIVE**

### Why This is a False Positive

1. **The vulnerability is in MiniZip**, which is part of zlib source code but:
   - Not built into the zlib binary packages in Debian 11 and 12
   - Not a supported part of the zlib product
   - The vulnerable code is not compiled into distributed binaries

2. **Debian Security Team Assessment**:
   - Marked as "ignored" for zlib packages
   - The security impact is negligible since vulnerable code is not included in binaries
   - Only the minizip package (separate from zlib) needed updates

3. **Our Mitigation**:
   - Added `apt-get upgrade` in all Dockerfile stages to ensure latest security patches
   - Using official Node.js slim images which are regularly updated
   - The vulnerable MiniZip code is never executed in our application

- [Debian Security Team Assessment](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-tracker/2024/10/msg00029.html)

### Action Required

No action required. This is a false positive due to:
- Google Cloud Security scanner checking package versions without understanding build context
- The vulnerable code exists in source but is not compiled into the binary packages we use

If this CVE continues to appear in security scans, it can be safely suppressed or acknowledged as a false positive.

## How to Handle False Positives

When a CVE is identified as a false positive:

1. **Verify the assessment** by checking:
   - Official security advisories
   - Distribution-specific security trackers
   - Whether the vulnerable code path is actually used

2. **Document the reasoning** in this file with:
   - CVE details and severity
   - Why it's a false positive
   - Any mitigations in place
   - References to official assessments

3. **Consider scanner configuration**:
   - Some scanners allow suppressing specific CVEs
   - Configure risk acceptance in your security tools
   - Keep documentation for audit purposes
