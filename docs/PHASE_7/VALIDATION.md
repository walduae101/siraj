**Test Steps**:
1. Send version 1 event to webhook
2. Check event is dropped with `verdict="drop_incompatible"`
3. Verify event sent to DLQ
4. Check compatibility metrics
5. Verify no points credited

**Expected Results**:

**Test Steps**:
1. Disable US webhook service
2. Send webhook to `hooks.siraj.life`

### 4. Queue Failover - US Worker Disabled

**Objective**: Verify EU worker processes via LB when US worker disabled

**Test Steps**:
1. Disable US worker service
2. Send webhook to trigger queue processing
3. Verify Pub/Sub delivers to worker LB
4. Check EU worker processes messages
5. Verify idempotency maintained
6. Re-enable US worker

**Expected Results**:

### 5. Throughput Test - 2x Normal Load

**Objective**: Verify system handles increased load across regions

**Test Steps**:
1. Send 2x normal webhook volume for 20 minutes
2. Monitor performance metrics by region
3. Check DLQ depth and processing
4. Verify no performance degradation
5. Check resource utilization

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ p95 webhook ACK < 50ms
- ✅ p95 worker processing < 250ms
- ✅ DLQ depth < 100 messages
- ✅ No performance degradation
- ✅ Balanced load distribution

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

**Evidence**: [Log queries, screenshots]

### 6. Auditor Validation - Zero Drift

**Objective**: Verify reconciliation shows zero drift and correct regional shares

**Test Steps**:
1. Run reconciliation job
2. Check published vs processed counts
3. Verify ledger sum vs wallet balance deltas
4. Check per-region processing shares
5. Verify top error classes

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Published = processed counts
- ✅ Ledger sum = wallet balance
- ✅ Regional shares match traffic distribution
- ✅ No significant error classes

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

**Evidence**: [Log queries, screenshots]
