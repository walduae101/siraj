## How to Create Indexes

### Method 1: Firebase Console
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Firestore Database â†’ Indexes
4. Click "Create Index"
5. Add the fields as specified above

### Method 2: Firebase CLI
```bash
# Deploy indexes from firestore.indexes.json
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

### Method 3: Auto-generated from Console Errors
When you run queries that require indexes, Firebase will show console errors with direct links to create the required indexes. Copy those URLs here:

## Index Creation URLs

*Add URLs from Firebase console errors here as they appear*

Example format:
```
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/your-project/firestore/indexes?create_composite=...
```
